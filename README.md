Buck Converter is a ciruit in which we reduce the value of voltage. In other ciruits there be the same function voltage is reduced by heat dissipation, instead in Buck Converter we increase the value of current
and decrease the value of voltage.

In this ciruit, we have used a voltage source of 24V and we have used N-channel Mosfet L switch. To the switch we have given a PWM signal of input to the gate terminal. This PWM signal is generated using
Astable Multivibrator using IC 555. Across this Connection, a diode of D_Schottly is conncected and an Inductor of value 0.154uH, Resistor of values 51k, 10k, 1.16 ohm, Capacitor of values 0.01uf, 100pf.
Now the output  is observed at the point connecting the Inductor and Capacitor. The Output of this circuit should ideally be reduced from 24V to a Lower Value. As shown in the picture our value is 8V, which is 
lesser than 8V.
